title: "About CSCI 5117 -- Developing the Interactive Web"
---

I teach [CSCI 5117][0]. The course website is locked away in the U of M's Moodle
installation, so this post will serve as an informational page for folks who would
like to know more.  From the [syllabus][1]:

> How do we use and evaluate modern frameworks for building dynamic web sites? This course will give students hands-on experience with several different modern approaches for developing web-based applications, and with tools for managing source code and cloud services for deploying web applications. More fundamentally, this course is collaborative in nature, and will therefore require students to practice teamwork and communication. As a class, we will test and evaluate many web technologies to deepen our understanding of their strengths and weaknesses, and opportunities for improving the state-of-the-art. Students will have freedom to be creative and pursue projects that are personally interesting.

This coming semester, Fall 2017, we will focus on the following core technologies:

* [express](https://expressjs.com/)
* [mongo](https://www.mongodb.com/)
* [react](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
* [react native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)

Along the way, we will also extensively use HTML, CSS, Git, GitHub, and Heroku.

You want more info? How about [the slides I'll show on the first day of class][2].
